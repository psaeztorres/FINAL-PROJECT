# *Study Objective:*

As we delve into Spain's role as a potential powerhouse for electricity from renewable or non-renewable sources, several critical questions emerge:

Is Spain genuinely on the right trajectory?

Is there a practical tipping point between the increasing demand for electricity and the generation of green or conventional energy?

In this  study, an exploration into the current electricity landscape is conducted, examining each autonomous community's role and the status of renewable and non-renewable projects both in Spain and globally. Join this exploration to assess whether Spain is moving towards a sustainable future or encountering hurdles on the path to achieving 100% electricity from renewable sources.
